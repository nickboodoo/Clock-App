# ProgrammingLanguages1
This is a project submission for my programming languages class

I will answer the required questions below:

Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
This is my clocks project. It is an object-oriented programming application in which I created two clocks that display simultaneously and allow for user input in manipulating the time. 

What did you do particularly well?
I think that I wrote the code pretty efficiently and I am proud of this project because it is one of the first OOP applications that I have made. 

Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?
I could probably enhance the readability of my code so that other collaborators or viewers can see what is going on much faster. 

Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?
I think getting the layout of the program was the hardest part. Usually the hardest part of programming for me is the beginning. 

What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?
It is an OOP application and I think that I will be able to carry that skill across other projects. 

How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
I took my time and deliberately wrote each line along with some careful planning.
